# discord-minecraft-afk-bot
This code aims to create a Minecraft AFK bot by combining Discord and Minecraft. Users can use a specific command in the Discord server to put the bot in AFK mode in Minecraft. The bot will move in Minecraft to stay AFK. Users can bring the bot back by typing "back". This way, users who want to go AFK in Minecraft can continue playing the game using the bot.
